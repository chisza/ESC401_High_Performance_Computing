```factor``` is a command, that splits a number in its composites -> a prime number returns only one value  

```wc``` has a flag ```-w```, that allows to count the words

when using the ```factor``` command, the number, that should be factorized, is repeated, meaning, that it returns 2, when combined with ```wc -w```, when it is a prime
