[measurements_regex.sh]('measurements_regex.sh') is a try. I was able to make it, that it takes an argument from the command line and then collects the required data, but not how to parse several files at once or how to get the average temperature.  

[python_measurements_regex.sh]('python_measurements_regex.sh') is the python version. It takes all the files with a ```.txt``` extension in the folder, parses them and also calculates the average temperature. To save the output to a file, use the command ``` ./python_measurements_regex.sh > out.txt```
